# AWS Configuration for S3 Content Fetching (required for fetch_content=True)
# Content is no longer returned directly by the API (as of v0.2.0)
# To fetch entry content, configure AWS credentials using one of two methods:

# Method 1: AWS Profile (recommended for local development)
# AWS profile name from ~/.aws/credentials
# This method takes PRIORITY over direct credentials if both are set
AWS_PROFILE_NAME=carver_aws_profile_name

# Method 2: Direct AWS Credentials (alternative to profile)
# Use this method when AWS profile is not available (e.g., CI/CD, containers)
# Both access key ID and secret key must be provided together
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id_here
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key_here

# AWS region (optional, defaults to us-east-1)
